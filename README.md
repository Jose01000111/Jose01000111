<h1>Hi, I'm Jose Guerrero, an <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/JoGuerrero">IT Professional</a>‚ò∫</h1>

<h3>Certifications:</h3>
I‚Äôm currently certified as a Microsoft IT Support Specialist and have my CompTIA Security+ certification. I‚Äôm wrapping up CompTIA A+ Core 1 and have started Core 2, along with LPIC-1 and Microsoft MD-102. The best way to truly learn is by using these technologies and working directly with the tools I will soon rely on. That‚Äôs why I prioritize hands-on experience in real-world environments, ensuring I‚Äôm not just studying theoritical concepts but also gaining practical and technical experiences.
