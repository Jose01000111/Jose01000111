<h3>📜Certifications:</h3>
I’ve approached IT support and cybersecurity with a genuine enthusiasm to learn and improve. While earning certifications has been an important part of that process, I’ve also made it a point to go beyond theory by applying the tools and concepts in practical, hands-on ways:

- CompTIA A+ Core 2 (220-1202) (In progress)

- LPIC-1 (In progress)

<h3>🏫Education:</h3>
As a proud graduate of the University of Chicago Cybersecurity Bootcamp and the Course Careers Infromation Technology Course, I’ve gained practical experience in IT support and cybersecurity.
